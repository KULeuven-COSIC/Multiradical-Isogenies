# Multiradical-Isogenies

The files contained in this repository are the Magma codes associated with the paper 'Multiradical Isogenies' by Wouter Castryck & Thomas Decru.

The file 33hash contains a proof of concept of a CGL hash function based on (3,3)-isogenies between superspecial principally polarised abelian surfaces.

The file 55formulae contains the formulae for the non-dual 5-torsion of the (5,5)-isogeny discussed as an example in the paper.

The file genus2divpol contains the code to generate the analogue of division polynomials on hyperelliptic curves of genus 2, which was used to find the 5-torsion of the file 55formulae.
